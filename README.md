# Final-Proj Web Design
Personal Portfolio for Callie

This website was created as part of my web design course in college. 
The project is a personal portfolio for my sister, Callie, an author.

To develop the site, I interviewed Callie as a client to understand her requirements. 
She provided a mockup design, which I implemented and enhanced with additional features. 
While she shared some of her writings for inspiration, she chose not to have them linked on the site for personal reasons.
