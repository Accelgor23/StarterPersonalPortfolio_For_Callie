                        <p>Dean Trevor's dream promotion turns into a daunting task

                            identity, keeping up with her quirks, and dealing with 
                            his growing feelings for her. Dean's loyalty to his job 
                            and his admiration for Lorewind's works are put to the test.</p>

                                meet his deadlines, and finally tame the author?</p>
